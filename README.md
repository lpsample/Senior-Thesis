##Abstract
Presently, we compare the emergent networks evolved by GridBot: a simulated bot that traverses a grid world. GridBot, intended to emulate an animal-like terrestrial robot, bears two light sensors, two infared sensors, and a front bumper. GridBotâ€™s goal is to collect as much light as possible in a 100 step trial from a stationary light source on the other side of the grid, avoiding obstacles that are in its path. We are interested in the evolved networks that result from a static environment that features set grid dimensions with stationary obstacles, compared to the networks that evolve in a dynamic environment that features changing dimensions and variably placed obstacles. We also compare methods of network evolution, utilizing a fixed-topology and augmenting topology approach. We find that the augmenting topology approach exceeds the fixed-topology approach in mean fitness across 100 generations, and that the dynamic condition yields a broader range of fitness within a given generation than the static condition in both the fixed and augmenting topology approaches. We conclude that further analysis and research is required to draw conclusions from our network data. We encourage future research on our finding that dynamic environments produce more variability within a population in terms of individual fitness, while also allowing higher fitness to be achieved, compared to static, stable environments.
